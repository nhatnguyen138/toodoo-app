# toodoo-app

TooDoo App is the first pseudo-project that I make to push onto GitHub for the purpose of promoting my persue of web design.

GitHub never had a place in my heart before. Mainly because I didn't have a habit to save my codes on the internet (I just deleted all of my pseudo-codes after use), or perhaps the reason could relate to _the history of me singlehandedly developing the entire group project by my own multiple times_. Alright, enough humble braggin'. Recently, realizing that it is beneficial for my career to publish my work online, I finally decided to make attempt to fill up the space that I have been missing out on GitHub, with the first baby step being this pseudo-project that I designed, developed and deployed by myself.

Although it might look boring and simple (and sound repetitive too), the product is the results of my learning and improvement over the years.

### ReactJS (+TypeScript)

The more I learn, the more I enjoy working with React. I will not say that it's the best framework out there, but it was so easy for me to pick up when I wanted to learn front-end development. Personally, I think I would still need a bit more industrial experience in order to have adequate professionalism in the codes, yet I consider myself an OK React developer (as long as I don't have to touch React class components, _**GOD I hate it!**_).

On the other hand, TypeScript is a cherry on the cake. I've just picked this up recently after I felt confident enough of my React skill. Though I never had a chance to take part in a project having a scope that required using TypeScript, it is regardless essential to pick up for my career. With TypeScript's surpringly strict rules, my coding consistency has been improved quite a lot.


### NodeJS

I can't really say that I'm good at doing NodeJS since it is just a framework that I use to code React onto, yet with all the deployment, libraries, builds and other  shenanigans I've gone through along the way, I believe I have quite some knowledge dealing with Node.


### CSS and/or SASS

It's funny that I have a strange enjoyment of adjusting every pixel in a web page. I'm probably sure that I'm diagnosed with OCD; hence, I got hooked learning CSS, and later SASS. From simple element formatting to all-device responsive layouts to animations, you name it. I really had a fun time trying everything out with CSS and SASS, and I'm planning to have some repositories dedicated to CSS and/or SASS in the future.


### MongoDB

To be honest, I used to learn back-end because of my horrific experience learning SQL in uni, _so yes, I suck at this_. While I will have to get onto SQL eventually, I pick up MongoDB as a jumpstart. I have quite some time working with GraphQL as well; however, mongoDB is considered more common, and with the scope of this pseudo-project I try not to complicate things.


Overall, it's a fun time making this. I will still update the code whenever I have some spare time, but it wouldn't be too much. _After all, it is just a demo..._
